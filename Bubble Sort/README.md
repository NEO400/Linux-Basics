# Bubble Sort Program

Bourne Shell program that uses the bubble sort algorithm to sort numbers given by the user into ascending order. The program prompts the user for the number of elements to sort and then asks for each number one by one. After taking input, the program prints the numbers in their original order and then prints the sorted numbers.
